- If both grippers are closed, perspective matrix does not change. 
- If a gripper is open then turns of that gripper do not affect the perspective matrix. 

If side gripper is closed and bottom gripper is open then:
	Clockwise on the side means: 
		top: back,
		bottom: front,
		front: top,
		back: bottom,
		left: left, 
		right: right;
		
		
	Counterclockwise on the side means: 
		top: front,
		bottom: back,
		front: bottom,
		back: top,
		left: left,  
		right: right; 
		
	
	Double on side means:
		top: bottom,
		bottom: top,
		front: back,
		back: front,
		left: left, 
		right: right;
		
		
If bottom gripper is closed and side gripper is open then:
	Clockwise on the bottom means: 
		top: top,
		bottom: bottom,
		front: right,
		back: left,
		left: front,
		right: back;
		

	Counterclockwise on the bottom means: 
		top: top, 
		bottom: bottom,
		front: left, 
		back: right,
		left: back,
		right: front;
		 
	
	Double on bottom means:
		top: top, 
		bottom: bottom,
		front: back, 
		back: front,
		left: right,
		right: left; 
		
	
	
AB are open and close respectively (Side Gripper).
	
CDEF are rotational positions of side gripper starting in default (horizontal), moving clockwise.

UV are open and close respectively (Bottom Gripper).

WXYZ are rotational positions of bottom gripper starting in default (back to front), moving clockwise.

(ACB) = Side Gripper Reset (default position)
(UWV) = Bottom Gripper Reset (default position)


First a command such as "turn g" gets converted to one of 18: turn u or turn U or turn U2
															  turn d or turn D or turn D2
															  turn f or turn F or turn F2
															  turn b or turn B or turn B2
															  turn l or turn L or turn L2
															  turn r or turn R or turn R2
